# Room Contasts List
This is a simple contacts list app that Creates, Reads and Deletes a 
Room database entry. This project was just a neat way of abstracting out 
a Room db implementation without the noise of everything that is in 
the project where I want to use Room.

# TODO
- Create a way to edit a DB Entry
- Clean up the Alert Dialog for entering an entry
- Clean up the composable for the contact screen, add some dimension via the following:
  Header
  Lines divider lines for contacts
  Background and maybe z stack the card composable on it
